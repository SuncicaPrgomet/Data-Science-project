Data Science Salary Analysis<br>
Title of the seminar paper: Salary analysis in the field of data science<br>
Dataset: data-science-salaries-2023.htm<br>
Analysis description:<br>
The data set contains information on years of work, level of experience, type of employment, type of employment, amount of salary, country of residence of the employee, percentage of working from home, location and size of the company.<br>
Considering the data in the data set, I think it would be interesting to find answers to the following questions:<br>
Do larger companies pay more and how does the average salary depend on the size of the company?<br>
In which country to look for a job in order to maximize the salary depending on the employee's experience level?<br>
Which country has the highest data science salaries?<br>
In which country do most people work full-time?<br>

I also find it interesting to observe:<br>
Average salaries depending on experience, location of the company, type of employment, ...<br>
Movement of the average salary and job demand by years<br>
Top 20 countries by average salary and job demand<br>
Distributions of certain variables<br>
Connection between variables (correlation matrix and hypothesis)<br>
  Grouping of given data<br>
  Forecasting wages using selected variables<br>


Techniques/algorithms that I will be using:<br>
EDA<br>
visualizations (lineplot, histplot, boxplot, countplot, pie...)<br>
descriptive and inferential statistics<br>
correlation matrix<br>
Regression<br>
linear<br>
polynomial<br>
Grouping<br>
K-means algorithm<br>
DBSCAN algorithm<br>
